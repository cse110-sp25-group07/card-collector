## 4 L's Method

From the [Digital Project Manager Article](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/projects/leadership-team-management/how-run-sprint-retrospective/) we utilized the 4 L's Method.

Using this method we went over what we liked, lacked, learned, and longed for in an efficient manner that let us critically think about what we accomplished during this sprint. It was helpful to create ideas of how we could improve the work we accomplished and our development and process of working as a team as a whole.

### Summary:

While we were happy with some of the work we accomplished, mainly the frontend pages of the card and deck components, we felt like we failed in how we communicated and divided up tasks as individuals and beyond tasks given to sub-teams. For next sprint we plan on improving by structuring the times we hold sprint planning, review, and retrospective at times that can contribute to our development (having them earlier) and giving individuals more of a structure of what exactly they need to g et done instead of increasing the amount of work each has to do by taking more agency on what needs to get done.

### Diagram:

We created a Miro Diagram summing up the highlights of what we wanted to get done using this 4 L's Method:
