## 4 L's Method

From the [Digital Project Manager Article](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/projects/leadership-team-management/how-run-sprint-retrospective/) we utilized the 4 L's Method.

### Summary:

This sprint was less organized than the other sprints since it was less feature based and more tying the app together. Each sub-team did their own final fixes and integrations. We still had very good communication and ended up accomplishing our goals for the most part.

### Diagram:

We created a Miro Diagram summing up the highlights of what we wanted to get done using this 4 L's Method:

### Notes:

We also documented our thoughts into the following notes prior to making the diagram:

Liked Items

- Communication among team leads was consistent
- We had longer conversations about logisitics of the app and catching user flow errors
- Lots of activity in the group, members with less to do still wanting to help out and actively reaching out.

Lacked Items

- Specific issues were less common this sprint, and although this made sense for the nature of the sprint (wrapping things up), it still left some members with less to do until the final day

Learned Items

- Even in a sprint that is less structured in terms of planning, some additional time should be spent to make sure that the work is equally distributed.
- Some additional coding standards should have been agreed on from the start to help the UI design team with their implementations

Longed For Items

- Wish we had more time to make final polishes to project, as well as built it in such a way that not just Pokemon collectors could have use for it.
