# Sprint 3 Retrospective

Date: 06/01/2025

Attendance: Ashton, Tanner, Jonathan, Guthry, Max, Karim, Graydon, and Luis

Location: Zoom

## 4 L's Method

From the [Digital Project Manager Article](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/projects/leadership-team-management/how-run-sprint-retrospective/) we utilized the 4 L's Method.

We utilized this method in Sprint 1 and 2's Retrospective and we liked how it gave us a solid framework with which we could reflect on Sprint 3's accomplishments but also critique what could've gone better.

### Summary:

This sprint went a lot better than the previous sprint. Our sub-team leaders delegated tasks really well, and a lot of members wrote code and communicated more this week. Being more transparent with how the time is counting down in the class and how the TA is inspecting each of our individual commitment to the project helped make people more motivated to work further on the project. Overall there isn't too many takeaways except keeping up the good work and dedicating ourselves to the final sprint 4.

### Diagram:

We created a Miro Diagram summing up the highlights of what we wanted to get done using this 4 L's Method:

### Notes:

We also documented our thoughts into the following notes prior to making the diagram:

Liked Items

- Communication style with team leads was good
- Bringing up blockers quickly and working on them within teams was great
- Actively communicating about meetings was also working well

Lacked Items

- Still missing communication from some members in individual teams

Learned Items

- As a team leads we should probably be setting the next meeting far in advance, maybe even do a lettucemeet.

Longed For Items

- Wish we had more time outside of studying for the CSE 110 Midterm
