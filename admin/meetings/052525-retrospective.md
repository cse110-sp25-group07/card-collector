# Sprint 2 Retrospective

Date: 5/25/2025

Attendance: Ashton, Tanner, Luis, Guthry, Max, and Karim

Location: Zoom

## 4 L's Method

From the [Digital Project Manager Article](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/projects/leadership-team-management/how-run-sprint-retrospective/) we utilized the 4 L's Method.

We utilized this method in Sprint 1's Retrospective and we liked how it gave us a solid framework with which we could reflect on Sprint 2's accomplishments but also critique what could've gone better.

### Summary:

This sprint was pretty tough in terms of not getting people to be transparent and attend meetings. While having sub-team leaders delegate tasks ws a good idea and worked in some groups, in others people didn't show up and didn't communicate what they could and couldn't work on. As a team we value people showing up and being transparent about what they can and can't work on but it's difficult when people don't do at least that. With the work we did accomplish we were happy about the contributions but overall we have a focus and mindset on scrapping everything together in this upcoming sprint to make sure we can accomplish what we planned for initially.

### Diagram:

We created a Miro Diagram summing up the highlights of what we wanted to get done using this 4 L's Method:

### Notes:

We also documented our thoughts into the following notes prior to making the diagram:

Liked Items
- Automated pipeline and documentation implementation
- Subteam leaders helped divide the work from the team leads and allow teams to drill in and focus on their features and components
- Focus on cleanliness and organization within the refactoring

Lacked Items
- Lacking communication from team members whether they weren’t participating or wouldn’t be able to contribute for this sprint due to external reasons
- Hard to accomplish work without members present at critical meetings or talking in the slack channel and also without committing any code/work on their tasks

Learned Items
- Being vocal about what you’re working on lets others know what you’ve accomplished and what they should work on as well

Longed For Items
- It’s crunch time and we all need to make sure to do our best to get as much done in the last sprint
- Managing external factors such as other classes and obligations can be tough but we need to prioritize the project as you would with a midterm for a class
